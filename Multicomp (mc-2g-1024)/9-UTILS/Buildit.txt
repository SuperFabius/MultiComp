Use the included AS.COM assembler. This is the stripped down version of Walter Bilofsky's UVMAC release 2.3 (The Software Toolworks)

This is a rudimentary absolute non macro assembler

OPCODES should be CAPS,
Symbols max 7 characters
no whitespace, except for separators
; and : are not a field separator (whitespace is needed)
ORG should reference addresses ahead of current address

Take care: JR z,addr is interpreted as JR addr. Write JR Z,addr

AS commandline is:
AS [OUTFILE,LISTFILE=]INFILE [>ERRFILE]
OUTFILE = .COM
INFILE = .ASM
LISTFILE = .LST

Also used is Pasmo Z80 cross assembler. See included manual in the DOC section
AS code is compatible with pasmo

Tools:

AS.COM		; Software Toolworks Z80 assembler version 2.3
UNLOAD.COM	; convert .COM files into .HEX files
pasmo(.exe)	; Portable Z80 Cross assembler.
RMAC.COM	; DR relocatable macro assembler version 1.1
LINK.COM	; linker loader version 1.31

Procedure:

AS DOWNLOAD		; produces DOWNLOAD.COM, ready to use binary
UNLOAD DOWNLOAD 4100	; produces DOWNLOAD.HEX for backdoor uploading
TYPE DOWNLOAD.HEX with terminal capture enabled
You can then copy paste the hexfiles from your terminal capture file


AS RESET		; produces RESET.COM, ready to use binary


pasmo MOUNT.ASM MOUNT.COM	; produces MOUNT.COM, ready to use binary


AS STARTUP		; produces STRARTUP.COM, ready to use binary


RMAC TIME.MAC		; Produces TIME.REL, relocatable binary
LINK TIME		; produces TIME.COM, ready to use binary


pasmo RDINIT.ASM RDINIT.COM	; produces RDINIT.COM, ready to use binary
