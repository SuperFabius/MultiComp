Use:
Same as CPM's "ERA" built-in command, except that "XERA" queries the
operator whether each file found may be erased.

XERA asks the operator if it is O.K. to erase the indicated files
before actually doing so. Entering anything other than "Y" or "y",
or typing ^C anytime prior to this question will terminate without
erasing any files.  The individual replies can be eliminated by
the G flag, and all replies by the GO flag.

"System" and "Read-Only" files are displayed but not erased. Normally
the "System" and "Read-Only" file attributes have been assigned for a
good reason, and thus these files should not be easily erasable.  In
order to erase them use CPM's built-in "ERA" command (for "System"
files) or set the file attributes to "DIR" and "R/W" using CPM's
"STAT" utility, and then rerun "XERA".

Example: A>xera pro*.*

	 A:PROG    .TXT ?  <Y> Yes
	 A:PROG    .COM    READ/ONLY and SYSTEM
	 A:PROG    .ASM ?  <N> No
	 A:PROG    .001    READ/ONLY
	 A:PROGRESS.BAS ?  <Y> Yes
	 A:PROGRESS.INT ?  <Y> Yes

	 O.K. to erase?    <Y> Yes

	 A>xera pro*.* G   (auto-answers Y to all but the last query)

	 A>xera pro*.* GO  (auto-answers Y to all queries)
