			XJOB for DOS+

XJOB is the logical replacement for XSUB, when using the DOS+
system.  Like XSUB, only BDOS function call 10 is handled.
However, XJOB can discriminate against commands (such as "dir")
in the job file, since it insists that each simulated console
line begin with a "*".  The "*" is stripped before the line is
passed to the application, and thus the maximum line length is
127 chars.  If a line without the "*" appears it is left in the
job, and console input is requested from the keyboard.  Since
CCP+ (part of the DOS+ system)  treats all lines with an initial
"*" as comments, this allows synchronization between application
jobs and their data.

Note that, like XSUB, XJOB cannot supply console data to any
program requesting input via calls 6 or 1, or by direct bios
calls.  These calls will require operator entries.

To supply an empty line (e.g. PIP exit command), supply only
the "*".

The job file should call XJOB before running any programs that
will need XJOB console input.  The job can also force XJOB
removal by calling it again.  Thus it is possible to intermix
pre-cooked and actual operator input.

Unlike the SUBMIT/XSUB combination, JOB/XJOB can supply lower
case input to the application with no fuss.  Simulated console
lines may even be parametized.  In addition, a simulated
console line containing ONLY a ^C (entered into the .JOB file
by "*^^C") will cause the application to reboot.
