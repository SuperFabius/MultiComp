Start your Quartus II software
Open project 14-Multicomp/Microcomputer/Microcomputer.qws
Upload output_files/Microcomputer.pof to your miniboard.

close Quartus, disconect miniboard

Copy image System18.img to your SD-card. Use direct imaging software (dd in Linux, Win32DiskImager in Windows). Copy to the start of the card. 

Insert SD card in your systemboard and powerup.

Notes: The default FPGA image supports serial terminals only. Because Grant's powerup routine uses the first two terminals, the CTS for these is set to "active" in the VHDL code. Otherwise the system may hang, trying to write to the second terminal.

Use 512 kByte SRAM as a minimum. Most OS-es will run in less but MP/M needs re-configuring. The BIOS will assume at least 512 kByte to be present for the RAM-disk.
