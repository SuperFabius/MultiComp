This package is an extension on the FPGA multicomputer, as introduced by Grant Searle, which can be found here: <http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html>, which focuses on the Z80 CP/M computer described therein.

The system's main specifications are:
 - New ROM monitor with multi-boot capability, Format, Getsys and Putsys tools and debug capabilities. No BASIC in ROM.
 - SD-HC capable card controller.
 - Multi volume disk system, which currently supports upto 254 8MB disk volumes (which uses 2GB+ on the SD-card). All these volumes can be loaded with a separate OS bootimage. 
 - OSes configured with 3 drives: A:, B: and C:. A: is the system drive (holding the volume booted from) while B: and C: can be assigned and re-assigned one of the remaining volumes. Also a RAM disk for CP/M 2 and CP/M 3
 - Y2k compatible system clock (date and time) for all OSes.

It runs on the EP2C5T144C8N Cyclone II FPGA and the configuration assumes it to be wired up as indicated on Grant's page. You should have wired up 2 serial terminals, an SD-card and at least 512k Memory.
James Moxhams Cyclone2v108 or 109 board will work without modifications. 
2 extra serial terminals can be wired to the touch screen connector, using RS-232 or USB converters.
 
This package contains FPGA updates for 
- ROM monitor; (new concept)
- SD-card controller; (with added SD-HC capability)
- Terminal; (adapted for US keyboards)
- MMU; (simplified version from the one introduced by James Moxham)
- Microcomputer .vdh file. (ROM-switch, timer interrupt, SD-clock)

These are available as source files, with additionally, the .pof file for the default configuration.

The package includes all binaries, sourcefiles, manuals and instructions for building and running CP/M 2.2,  C.B. Falconer's Dos+ 2.5, CP/M 3.1, MP/M 2.1, ZSDOS 1.1/ZCPR2 and ZPM3/ZCCP including tools for the additional features (disk mounting system reset etc.) The original ROM BASIC remains available as a loadable module.
The OS specific transient commands are included as binary only.
Included is also an image file containing the first 18 volumes, pre-loaded with the above operating systems and extra software.

The board is fitted with connectors for 4 serial interfaces, VGA and RCA monitor and a PS/2 keyboard. All of these are wired in accordance with Grant Searles and James Moxhans "standards" All serial interfaces are equipped with full handshake, which will cause problems, sometimes. 
a. Grants console activation will hang on the second serial interface when not plugged in, because CTS is not driven low. 
b. devices without RTS/CTS will not work (particularly the ESP8266 module)
Herefore the CTS inputs can be fitted with a weak pull down resistor.
