INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for Grant Searle's Multicomputer revisited.
=====================================================================

-  Build Grant's original CM/M machine as per instructions on his web page.
this in not strictly necessary, but it is a valuable learning experience.

-  Start the Quartus II software
-  Locate a Multicomp directory in the distribution package. 
   There are 3 pre-programmed configurations; RCA, VGA, or TTY terminal.
-  Open the Microcomputer project in Quartus II and build it.
-  Download the result to your Cyclone (EPCS4) chip.

You now have a 25 MHz Z80 system, configured with MMU, 4 Serial interfaces, SC/HC SD-card interface (running at 25 MHz), programmable baudrates, 50 Hz system clock  and 2K internal ROM with the new monitor installed.

-  Insert SD card
-  Start the computer. you should see the monitor menu after hitting <space>

-  Type Iddd
-  Type Snnn to start CP/M 2.2 (previous install)
-  Type MOUNT B:ddd
-  Type B:
-  Locate DOSPlusFilesPkg.txt and copy-paste the contents at the CP/M prompt.
-  Type RESET (the command, not the button)
-  Type Sddd to start in Dos+

Install CP/M-3 on volume eee
============================
-  Type RESET followed by space
-  Locate CPM3LDR.HEX file and copy-paste the contents at the monitor prompt.
-  Type Peee,E000
-  Type Ieee
-  Type Snnn to start CP/M 2.2 (previous install)
-  Type MOUNT B:eee
-  Type B:

-  Type RESET (the command, not the button)
-  Type Seee to start CP/M-3

Install MP/M-2 on volume fff
============================
-  Type RESET followed by space
-  Locate MPMLDR.HEX file and copy-paste the contents at the monitor prompt.
-  Type Pfff,E000
-  Type Ifff
-  Type Snnn to start CP/M 2.2 (previous install)
-  Type MOUNT B:fff
-  Type B:
-  Locate MPM2FilesPkg.txt and copy-paste the contents at the CP/M prompt.
-  Type RESET (the command, not the button)

Install BASIC on volume ggg
===========================
-  Type RESET followed by space
-  Locate BASIC.HEX file and copy-paste the contents at the monitor prompt.

-  Type Gxxx
-  Type Pyyy,llll	(llll - loadaddress)
-  Type Sxxx

notes: 
- the monitor accepts Volume numbers 1-254. Only use numbers that your SD-card accomodates. Avoid Volume number 254, as this number indicates the RAM disk in CP/M
- I have issues with PIP. Use PPIP instead
