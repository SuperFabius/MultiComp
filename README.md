# Multi-Computer

This repo contains my edits to Grant Searle's excellent Multi-Comp project (http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html).

Multi-Comp is a project to recreate many of the early Retro Computers using technology of the late 70's and 80s. The project uses VHDL and an inexpensive Altera Cyclone II FPGA card (http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.XEP2+FPGA.TRS0&_nkw=EP2+FPGA&_sacat=0) with some customized connectors.

Grant Searle owns most of the original source files. See the comments at the start of the VHDL code for ownership and copyright statements. All the credit goes to Grant for an excellent design and any mistakes I introduced are my own.

My small contribution is to make a PCB that has the connectors on it. And to get NTSC video timing working for North America. My project is documented on my Wiki (http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=EP2C5-DB).
