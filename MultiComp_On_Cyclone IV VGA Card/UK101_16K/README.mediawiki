== UK101 MultiComp On a Commercial Cyclone IV VGA Card - VHDL Code ==

These files are [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html Grant Searle's Multicomp] Retro-Computer with [https://github.com/nealcrook/multicomp6809/wiki enhancements by Neal Crook and others]. Grant's project re-creates late 1970's and early 1980's era vintage computers using inexpensive FPGA cards. The various builds that make up different vintage retro-computers are in each of the folders.

The UK101 code uses composite video out. The board does not have a composite video out but it does route the VGA digital lines to the I/O connector so a composite video out can be produced with an RCA connector and two resistors. The I/O connector pinout is:

Alternately, the resistor chain on the VGA connector could be manipulated to do the voltage summing that is required for Composite video output.

The card used is a commercial product [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Cyclone_IV_FPGA_EP4CE6E22C8N_Development_Board_USB_V2 described here].

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

* Use at your own risk.
