== M6809 MultiComp On a Commercial Cyclone IV VGA Card - VHDL Code ==

These files are the M6809 version of [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html Grant Searle's Multicomp] Retro-Computer with [https://github.com/nealcrook/multicomp6809/wiki enhancements by Neal Crook and others]. Grant's project re-creates late 1970's and early 1980's era vintage computers using inexpensive FPGA cards. This build has the following:

* M6809 Core
* VGA display (as enhanced by Neal Crook)
* PS/2 keyboard
* 16K RAM (internal to FPGA)

The card used is a commercial product [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Cyclone_IV_FPGA_EP4CE6E22C8N_Development_Board_USB_V2 described here].

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
